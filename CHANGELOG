CHANGELOG

1.2.1
====

A small release to address some previous issues and errors.

  * Removed non-root user cron jobs
  * Fixed issue in which the grep string did not match the mount point of the ISO
  * The summary in metadata used to throw an error, it has been shortened to fix this

1.2.0
====

  * Add ability specify package source protocol other than git
  * Add ability to specify source version other than latest
  * Add ability to use ip_based vhost
  * Fix some RHN related issues.
  * Add ability to specify releases and release types (eg, 6Server)
  * Add ability to customize mrepo command, options, environment vars
  * Add `mrepo::repos` for hiera integration.

1.1.1
=====

NOTE: This version requires puppetlabs/apache 0.6.0, which is a backwards
incompatible release. If you are using that module elsewhere then you'll need
to resolve the upgrade for apache first.

  * Manage /var/log/mrepo.log so that mrepo user can write to it while running
  * Remove dependency cycle when using mrepo with apache
  * Don't use `undef` for rhn username or password


1.1.0
=====

  * Correct invalid Modulefile dependency
  * Changes to conform to style guide.
  * Allow tuning of email recipient
  * Add in mrepo::exports class
  * Add in support for creating NFS shares of mrepo disks. This is primarily
    needed for mirroring and building on SLES.

1.0.0
=====

This is a backwards incompatible release.

  * Split out mirroring for RHN and NCC repositories, since they have
    nontrivial amounts of logic needed to authenticate to the mirror source.
  * Add hour parameter to mrepo::repo define to permit staggering
    synchronization time.
  * Add mrepo::iso define. This will copy ISOs from to the mrepo host for
    mirroring from ISOs. This adds a dependency on nanliu-staging
  * Clean up repository name munging by extracting the logic into a Puppet
    function.
  * Respect mrepo docroot for apache
